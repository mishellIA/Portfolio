## 📊 Featured Projects

### 1. 🧠 ThinkxIA: Personality types from thinking styles and traits.
*This project explores how thinking styles and personality traits cluster into distinct psychological profiles using unsupervised machine learning. By
applying K-means clustering to validated trait data, it identifies emergent personality types that differ in meaningful and interpretable ways. The
results are presented through an interactive R Shiny app designed for exploration and reflection, rather than assessment.*

### 2. 🌿 InnerliAI: Predicting Vitality from Personality and Basic Psychological Needs
*InnerliAI is an interactive machine learning demo that explores how psychological factors and traits— like self-determination, 
basic psychological needs and dark traits — may relate to self-reported vitality.*

### 3. 💼 EmploIA: A multidimensional psychological model of employability
*This project combines behavioral science and machine learning to explore the psychological roots of employability in young adults. Using validated
scales and a gradient boosting model, it allows users to interactively examine how factors such as mindfulness, self-concept or narcissism may relate to
perceived employability — all through a live R Shiny app. While not intended for assessment, the tool offers an engaging way to reflect on the science of
adaptability in career.* 

Key findings:

Drive — tendency to follow own goals — is a key predictor of employability in young adults.
There are other influential contributors: higher narcissism,  and lower modesty.
